Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.

Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\n\nSeveral Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added.
