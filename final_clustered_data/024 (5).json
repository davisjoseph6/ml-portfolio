Hundreds of photos of the person's head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it's really quite incredible how detailed they are,\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\"\n",
