        "Pompeii gets digital make - over The old - fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer - generated images that bring the site to life. A European Wedlock - funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer - augmented versions of archaeological attractions. It would give up visitors a coup d'oeil of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii. It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism. The technology would allow digital people and other computer - generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site. The Lifeplus project is part of the EU ' s Data Society Technologies initiative aimed at encourage user - friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage. Engineers and researchers working in the Europe - wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented - reality system. It would require the visitor to wear a head - mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor ' s viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life.
