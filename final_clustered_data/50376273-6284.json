In\nthe fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two gone\nfunctions, ede2\" and cde 10\", have been demonstrated to\nbe required at START (Aves ot al., 1985; Brook ot al,\n1981; Nurse and Bisset, 1981; Nurse el al, 1976).

Many of these genes encode\n«enzymatic components ofthe replication machinery (e.g,\nPOLI, POLS, PRIT, PRI2, e.), while olhers encode pro-\nteins thought to participate inthe initiation of S phase,\n‘such as COCB and DBFS. The promoter regions ofallthese\n‘gones contain the sequence ACGCGT or a closely related\n‘sequence, called the Mlul coll cyclo box (MCB) element\n(Gordon and Campbell, 1991; Lowndes eta. 1991; Mcln-\ntosh eta, 1991; Verma eta, 1991) This MCB element\n's suticiont to confer call cyclo contol on heterologous\npromoters (Lowndes etl. 1991), An MCB binding activity\ncalled DSCt (or MCBF; Lowndes otal, 1991; Verma at\nal, 1991) that is present transiently in lato G1 has bean\n‘dented in crude yeast col extracts, consistent with a\n‘ole in the periodic actvation of transcription. The SWS\nProtein is an essential component of OSCt (Lowndes et\nA, 1992a; Dirck tal, 1992) and of a second cal cycle-\n‘regulated ONA binding activity called SBF (Andrews and\nHerskowitz, 1989, 19896; Taba ta, 1991).
